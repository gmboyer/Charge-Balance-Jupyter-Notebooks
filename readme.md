About:
-

**MasterInput.csv** - the input file containing aqueous geochemical data in the style of GEOPIG's master spreadsheet. Customize this with your own samples of interest.

**ChargeBalance** - takes tabular water chemistry measurements, runs them through geochemical software called EQ3/6, then datamines charge balance values from output files. This is a collaborative effort between Arizona State University graduate students Grayson Boyer and Tucker Ely, and University of Washington Professor Mark Ghiorso as a part of the NSF-funded ENKI project to produce freely available geochemical tools.

**MineralMine** - obtain mineral solubility information (affinities or logQ/K) from your samples. Requires running ChargeBalance first.

**AquaMine** - obtain aqueous speciation information (molalities, log activities, etc.) from your samples. Requires running ChargeBalance first.

**CleanupDANGER** - deletes all files and folders created by ChargeBalance.
